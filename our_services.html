        The Department for Automation and Remuneration is here to provide you
        with an income now that you have lost your job to automation. The
        service is not provided automatically when you lose your job. You must
        apply on our website and within 3 weeks you will receive a statement
        which will outline your plan of 12 monthly payments.
      </p>

   

      <p>
        You may be asking yourself “who pays for this?”. Since the rise of
        automation, big corporations, who had previously paid little to no tax,
        are now required to pay the rightful amount due. With this money, DAR
        can provide you with an income to help you with your living costs and
        your reskilling process.Reskilling offers you the chance to re-enter
        the work sector at a lower risk of being automated.  
      </p>

      <h1><a id="findoutmore"> </a> <a id="eligibility"></a> Eligibility</h1>

      <p>
        The Department for Automation and Remuneration requires you to have lost
        your job due to automation. This means that technology has replaced the
        process, procedure or job that you used to perform. If you are unsure
        whether you lost your job to automation you can review your letter of
        termination as it should specify the reasoning behind your redundancy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>
          Other factors which will affect your eligibility for receiving the
          DAR’s universal credit are:</b

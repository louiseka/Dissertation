      <h1>The Process</h1>

      <p>
        So, what is the process? Once you have checked your
        <a href="./our_services.html#eligibility">Eligibility</a> you may then
        start the process of applying for our DAR universal credit which you can
        do here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team aims to deliver your confirmation and initial universal basic
        income statement within 3 weeks. You are then either paid on the 1st,
        9th or 28th of every month, this depends solely on when you receive your
        confirmation letter. After a year of being part of our DAR scheme you
        will have to renew your application with up to date details on your
        reskilling process and employment status. If you find work whilst you
        are receiving our DAR universal credit you must
        <a href="./contact_us.html"> Report a Change </a> with us. If you fail
        to do so you may have to face legal action.
      </p>

      <h1><a id="findoutmore"> </a>How You're Paid</h1>

      <p>
        Each month you are paid your universal credit allowance into your bank,
        building society or credit union account. If you do not have any of
        these accounts, we are unable to provide an alternative method of
        payment, so we advise that you apply for one of them. The payment will
        be either on the 1st, 9th or 28th of every month.
      </p>
      <p><b>First Payment:</b></p>
      <p>
        It will take up to 3 weeks for you to receive a confirmation and
        statement. Then your first payment will be made on the next available
        date, 1st, 9th or 28th, and this will be the same date you are paid for
        the next 11 months. Your confirmation and initial universal basic income
        statement will state which date your payment is due.
      </p>
      <p><b> For example:</b></p>
      <p>
        If you receive your letter on the 31st May, you will receive your
        payment on the 1st June.
      </p>
      <p>You will then be paid on the 1st of every month after that.</p>
      <p><b>Payment Dates:</b></p>
      <p>
        If your payment date falls on a bank holiday or the weekend, you will
        then be paid on the next available working day.
      </p>
      <p><b>Living with your partner:</b></p>
      <p>
        The same rules as above apply. The payment will be made to personal
        accounts of both you and your partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >If youâ€™ve been paid too much, you may have to repay the money if
          you:</b
